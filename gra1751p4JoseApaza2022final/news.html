	  Imagine Dragons Release 'Wrecked' Song; <br>Dan Reynolds Explains What Inspired the Emotional Lyrics
	  </h1>
	  <p>
	  The Grammy-winning band Imagine Dragons just released their new single “Wrecked” and they also announced their upcoming fifth studio album!<br><br>

Mercury – Act 1 is going to be released on September 3 and the band worked with legendary producer Rick Rubin for the new album.<br><br>

“Wrecked” was written by the band’s lead vocalist Dan Reynolds and he has opened up about the emotional story behind the song.<br><br>


Dan revealed in a new statement that he started writing the song shortly after losing his sister-in-law, Alisha Durtschi Reynolds, to cancer.<br><br>

“She was the brightest light. A beacon of joy and strength for everyone she met. Her sudden passing has shaken me in ways that I still am unable to express,” Dan said. “I was with her and my brother when she passed, and it was the first time in my life that I had witnessed death in this way. It sealed into my mind the fragility of life and finality of this all. I’ve watched my brother face something that no one should have to. But I’ve also seen his faith bring him hope in a future with her. I can only hope for the same. This song was my way of dealing with it all, as music has always been my refuge. No longer being a man of fervent faith, I can only hope that she hears it somewhere in a place where she is healed and no longer in pain. This song is my wish for an eternity with those that I love.”
