	   <h2>ABBA Celebrates 2.5 Million Copies of 'Voyage' Sold Worldwide</h2>
	  <p>One year has passed since ABBA released their first studio album in nearly 40 years – Voyage. The album has sold 2,5 million copies worldwide and today ABBA was honored with a plaque for this milestone, accepted on behalf of ABBA by Benny.</p>
	  <h2>In Focus: ABBA Gold at 30</h2>
	  <p>Three decades have passed since the amazing hits collection ABBA Gold was first released – and today it is one of the biggest albums of all time.</p>
	  <h2>ABBA Voyage</h2>
	  <p>It’s been a while since we made music together. Almost 40 years, actually. We took a break in the spring of 1982 and now we’ve decided it’s time to end it. They say it’s foolhardy to wait more than 40 years between albums, so we’ve recorded a follow-up to “The Visitors”. To tell the truth, the main inspiration to record again comes from our involvement in creating the strangest and most spectacular concert you could ever dream of. We’re going to be able to sit back in an audience and watch our digital selves perform our songs on a stage in a custom-built arena in London next spring. Weird and wonderful!</p>
	  <h2>In Focus: In The Studio - How the Classic ABBA Songs Were Born</h2>
	  <p>ABBA’s many classic hits were the result of intuitive creativity. “The studio work was the best part of it all: to shape the songs and try to interpret them in your own way.” Those were the words of ABBA’s Agnetha Fältskog, as she looked back on the decade-long series of pop classics that the group gave to the world. “I’ve always felt that the studio work was our strength,” she continued. “That’s where everything came into being – that’s where we created.”</p>
