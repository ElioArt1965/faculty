	<h1>Dreams</h1>
	<h2>Edgar Allan Poe, 1809 - 1849</h2>
	<p>Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!
		My spirit not awak’ning till the beam
		Of an Eternity should bring the morrow:
		Yes! tho’ that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
		’Twere better than the dull reality
		Of waking life to him whose heart shall be,
		And hath been ever, on the chilly earth,
		A chaos of deep passion from his birth!</p><br>
	
	<p>But should it be — that dream eternally
		Continuing — as dreams have been to me
		In my young boyhood — should it thus be given,
		’Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven!
		For I have revell’d, when the sun was bright
		In the summer sky; in dreamy fields of light,
		And left unheedingly my very heart
		In climes of mine imagining — apart
		From mine own home, with beings that have been
		Of mine own thought — what more could I have seen?</p><br>
		
		<p>’Twas once and only once and the wild hour
		From my remembrance shall not pass — some power
		Or spell had bound me — ’twas the chilly wind
		Came o’er me in the night and left behind
		Its image on my spirit, or the moon
		Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
		Too coldly — or the stars — howe’er it was
		That dream was as that night wind — let it pass.</p><br>
		 
	<p>I have been happy — tho’ but in a dream.
		I have been happy — and I love the theme —
		Dreams! in their vivid colouring of life —
		As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife
		Of semblance with reality which brings
		To the delirious eye more lovely things
		Of Paradise and Love — and all our own!
		Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.</p>
