	<h2>Come along this journey of friendship and loyalty, as Stitch and Lilo embark on an adventure. Lilo had no idea that the dog she was adopted was not a dog in the first place, but a genetic experiment named Stitch. Stitch escaped from his alien planet and ended up on earth; While there he meets Lilo! The two didn't get along so well in the beginning, however as time progressed, they each learned the true meaning of Ohana.</h2>
